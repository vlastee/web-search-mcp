# Web Search MCP Server for use with Local LLMs

A TypeScript MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides comprehensive web search capabilities using direct connections (no API keys required) with multiple tools for different use cases.

## Features

- **Multi-Engine Web Search**: Prioritises Bing > Brave > DuckDuckGo for optimal reliability and performance
- **Full Page Content Extraction**: Fetches and extracts complete page content from search results
- **Multiple Search Tools**: Three specialised tools for different use cases
- **Smart Request Strategy**: Switches between playwright browesrs and fast axios requests to ensure results are returned
- **Concurrent Processing**: Extracts content from multiple pages simultaneously

## How It Works

The server provides three specialised tools for different web search needs:

### 1. `full-web-search` (Main Tool)
When a comprehensive search is requested, the server uses an **optimised search strategy**:
1. **Browser-based Bing Search** - Primary method using dedicated Chromium instance
2. **Browser-based Brave Search** - Secondary option using dedicated Firefox instance
3. **Axios DuckDuckGo Search** - Final fallback using traditional HTTP
4. **Dedicated browser isolation**: Each search engine gets its own browser instance with automatic cleanup
5. **Content extraction**: Tries axios first, then falls back to browser with human behavior simulation
6. **Concurrent processing**: Extracts content from multiple pages simultaneously with timeout protection
7. **HTTP/2 error recovery**: Automatically falls back to HTTP/1.1 when protocol errors occur

### 2. `get-web-search-summaries` (Lightweight Alternative)
For quick search results without full content extraction:
1. Performs the same optimised multi-engine search as `full-web-search`
2. Returns only the search result snippets/descriptions
3. Does not follow links to extract full page content

### 3. `get-single-web-page-content` (Utility Tool)
For extracting content from a specific webpage:
1. Takes a single URL as input
2. Follows the URL and extracts the main page content
3. Removes navigation, ads, and other non-content elements

## Compatibility

This MCP server has been developed and tested with **LM Studio**, **LibreChat**, and **Continue**. It has not been tested with other MCP clients.

### Model Compatibility
**Important:** Prioritise using more recent models designated for tool use. 

Older models (even those with tool use specified) may not work or may work erratically. This seems to be the case with Llama and Deepseek. Qwen3 and Gemma 3 currently have the best restults.

- ✅ Works well with: **Qwen3**
- ✅ Works well with: **Gemma 3**
- ✅ Works with: **Llama 3.2**
- ✅ Works with: Recent **Llama 3.1** (e.g 3.1 swallow-8B)
- ✅ Works with: Recent **Deepseek R1** (e.g 0528 works)
- ⚠️ May have issues with: Some versions of **Llama** and **Deepseek R1**
- ❌ May not work with: Older versions of **Llama** and **Deepseek R1**

## Installation (Recommended)

**Requirements:**
- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- npm 8.0.0 or higher

1. Download the latest release zip file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/mrkrsl/web-search-mcp/releases)
2. Extract the zip file to a location on your system (e.g., `~/mcp-servers/web-search-mcp/`)
3. **Open a terminal in the extracted folder and run:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npx playwright install
   npm run build
   ```
   This will create a `node_modules` folder with all required dependencies, install Playwright browsers, and build the project.

   **Note:** You must run `npm install` in the root of the extracted folder (not in `dist/`).

   **Ubuntu 25.10 (Questing Quokka) Users:** If you encounter `libicu74` or `libxml2` not found errors, create compatibility symlinks:
   ```bash
   # Create libxml2 symlink
   sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxml2.so.16 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxml2.so.2
   
   # Create libicu symlinks
   sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libicuuc.so.76.1 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libicuuc.so.74
   sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libicui18n.so.76.1 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libicui18n.so.74
   sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libicudata.so.76.1 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libicudata.so.74
   ```
   Then retry `npx playwright install`.

4. Configure your MCP client to point to the extracted `dist/index.js` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "web-search": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/extracted/web-search-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```
**Example paths:**
- macOS/Linux: `~/mcp-servers/web-search-mcp/dist/index.js`
- Windows: `C:\\mcp-servers\\web-search-mcp\\dist\\index.js`

In LibreChat, you can include the MCP server in the librechat.yaml. If you are running LibreChat in Docker, you must first mount your local directory in docker-compose.override.yml.

in `docker-compose.override.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  api:
    volumes:
    - type: bind
      source: /path/to/your/mcp/directory
      target: /app/mcp
```
in `librechat.yaml`:
```yaml
mcpServers:
  web-search:
    type: stdio
    command: node
    args:
    - /app/mcp/web-search-mcp/dist/index.js
    serverInstructions: true
```

### Continue Configuration

Add to your Continue `config.json` (usually at `~/.continue/config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": [
    {
      "name": "web-search",
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/web-search-mcp/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example Continue config with environment variables:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": [
    {
      "name": "web-search",
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/home/user/mcp-servers/web-search-mcp/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH": "10000",
        "DEFAULT_TIMEOUT": "6000",
        "MAX_BROWSERS": "3",
        "BROWSER_HEADLESS": "true"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Troubleshooting:**
- If `npm install` fails, try updating Node.js to version 18+ and npm to version 8+
- If `npm run build` fails, ensure you have the latest Node.js version installed
- For older Node.js versions, you may need to use an older release of this project
- **Content Length Issues:** If you experience odd behavior due to content length limits, try setting `"MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH": "10000"`, or another value, in your `mcp.json` environment variables:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "web-search": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/web-search-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH": "10000",
        "BROWSER_HEADLESS": "true",
        "MAX_BROWSERS": "3",
        "BROWSER_FALLBACK_THRESHOLD": "3"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Environment Variables

The server supports several environment variables for configuration:

- **`MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`**: Maximum content length in characters (default: 500000)
- **`DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`**: Default timeout for requests in milliseconds (default: 6000)
- **`MAX_BROWSERS`**: Maximum number of browser instances to maintain (default: 3)
- **`BROWSER_TYPES`**: Comma-separated list of browser types to use (default: 'chromium,firefox', options: chromium, firefox, webkit)
- **`BROWSER_FALLBACK_THRESHOLD`**: Number of axios failures before using browser fallback (default: 3)

### Search Quality and Engine Selection

- **`ENABLE_RELEVANCE_CHECKING`**: Enable/disable search result quality validation (default: true)
- **`RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD`**: Minimum quality score for search results (0.0-1.0, default: 0.3)
- **`FORCE_MULTI_ENGINE_SEARCH`**: Try all search engines and return best results (default: false)
- **`DEBUG_BROWSER_LIFECYCLE`**: Enable detailed browser lifecycle logging for debugging (default: false)

## Troubleshooting

### Slow Response Times
- **Optimised timeouts**: Default timeout reduced to 6 seconds with concurrent processing for faster results
- **Concurrent extraction**: Content is now extracted from multiple pages simultaneously
- **Reduce timeouts further**: Set `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT=4000` for even faster responses (may reduce success rate)
- **Use fewer browsers**: Set `MAX_BROWSERS=1` to reduce memory usage

### Search Failures
- **Check browser installation**: Run `npx playwright install` to ensure browsers are available
- **Try headless mode**: Ensure `BROWSER_HEADLESS=true` (default) for server environments
- **Network restrictions**: Some networks block browser automation - try different network or VPN
- **HTTP/2 issues**: The server automatically handles HTTP/2 protocol errors with fallback to HTTP/1.1

### Search Quality Issues
- **Enable quality checking**: Set `ENABLE_RELEVANCE_CHECKING=true` (enabled by default)
- **Adjust quality threshold**: Set `RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD=0.5` for stricter quality requirements
- **Force multi-engine search**: Set `FORCE_MULTI_ENGINE_SEARCH=true` to try all engines and return the best results

### Memory Usage
- **Automatic cleanup**: Browsers are automatically cleaned up after each operation to prevent memory leaks
- **Limit browsers**: Reduce `MAX_BROWSERS` (default: 3)
- **EventEmitter warnings**: Fixed - browsers are properly closed to prevent listener accumulation

## MCP Tools

This server provides three specialised tools for different web search needs:

### 1. `full-web-search` (Main Tool)
The most comprehensive web search tool that:
1. Takes a search query and optional number of results (1-10, default 5)
2. Performs a web search (tries Bing, then Brave, then DuckDuckGo if needed)
3. Fetches full page content from each result URL with concurrent processing
4. Returns structured data with search results and extracted content
5. **Enhanced reliability**: HTTP/2 error recovery, reduced timeouts, and better error handling

**Example Usage:**
```json
{
  "name": "full-web-search",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "TypeScript MCP server",
    "limit": 3,
    "includeContent": true
  }
}
```

### 2. `get-web-search-summaries` (Lightweight Alternative)
A lightweight alternative for quick search results:
1. Takes a search query and optional number of results (1-10, default 5)
2. Performs the same optimised multi-engine search as `full-web-search`
3. Returns only search result snippets/descriptions (no content extraction)
4. Faster and more efficient for quick research

**Example Usage:**
```json
{
  "name": "get-web-search-summaries",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "TypeScript MCP server",
    "limit": 5
  }
}
```

### 3. `get-single-web-page-content` (Utility Tool)
A utility tool for extracting content from a specific webpage:
1. Takes a single URL as input
2. Follows the URL and extracts the main page content
3. Removes navigation, ads, and other non-content elements
4. Useful for getting detailed content from a known webpage

**Example Usage:**
```json
{
  "name": "get-single-web-page-content",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://example.com/article",
    "maxContentLength": 5000
  }
}
```
